## Promotion

* [My blog post "Get on your soapbox! R blog content and promotion"](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/16/soapbox/)

* [How to have (my) content shared by R Weekly?](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org#how-to-have-my-content-shared-by-r-weekly)

* Look into how to add a (category specific) RSS feed to your blog, if there's not one by default. For R Bloggers, that feed needs to feature the full content of posts.

## Analytics

If you use another service than Google Analytics, I'd be glad to hear about your experience.
