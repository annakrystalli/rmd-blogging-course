## Promotion

* [My blog post "Get on your soapbox! R blog content and promotion"](https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/16/soapbox/)

* [How to have (my) content shared by R Weekly?](https://github.com/rweekly/rweekly.org#how-to-have-my-content-shared-by-r-weekly)

* Look into how to add a (category specific) RSS feed to your blog, if there's not one by default. For R Bloggers, that feed needs to feature the full content of posts.

## Analytics

If you use another service than Google Analytics, I'd be glad to hear about your experience.

## Negative feedback

* The topic of negative feedback is mentioned in [The Ladybug podcast about Blogging](https://www.ladybug.dev/episodes/blogging-101?rq=blogging)

* When you are wrong, don't get defensive. Thread below.

* Twitter [soft block](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Soft%20Block). You can also _mute_ people.
