## Read the manual :wink:

You can read the [whole hugodown docs](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) and probably should especially as hugodown evolves.

Also read the docs of the theme you choose, and follow its development.

You might not need to read [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), that are much longer, much more overwhelming: you mostly only need to read Hugo docs when you need to tweak or customize a theme.

## Contributing guide for your website

Personal website: take notes to not forget what you tweaked, etc.

Collaborative website: even Hugo users might not know your website structure!

* [rOpenSci blog guide](https://blogguide.ropensci.org/)

* [golemverse website contributing guide](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golemverse.org/blob/master/how-to.Rmd)


## Another R package: blogdown

[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is an alternative to hugodown. [hugodown vs blogdown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/#compared-to-blogdown)

## Hugo template development/tweaking

* How _I_ started: I needed to tweak one thing in an existing theme and I googled that thing; then I had to tweak one more thing; etc. Others might have built a theme from scratch.

* What you must know according to Steph Locke

## Hugo and CMS

To give a less technical interface to a Hugo website, you could use a CMS, see for instance [what Steph Locke set up in this website with Netlify CMS](https://github.com/hzi-braunschweig/serohub).

## Hugo Academic

You can build many different websites with Hugo Academic, check out [Alison Hill's work](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) and also [Yanina Bellini's work](https://yabellini.netlify.app/).

There's a [Python CLI to import your publications](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin), featured in [the blog post "Fixing Imports to Hugo"](https://dyerlab.org/post/fixing-imports-to-hugo/)
