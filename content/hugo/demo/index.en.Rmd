-  install Hugo. new RStudio empty project.

- `hugo new site . --force` from the command line in that new folder.

- `hugodown::hugo_start()`

- copy-paste from [hugodown setup vignette](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/articles/config.html)

- create static/code.css from https://github.com/maelle/goodpress/blob/main/inst/css/code.css and create layouts/partial/head_custom.html according to https://xmin.yihui.org/about/ (one should read theme docs!)

- create post in post and copy-paste from snippets page. knit, preview.

- add maths, citations.

- for mathjax copy paste from https://xmin.yihui.org/about/ and say one should always read the docs!

- Netlify drag and drop

- then something easier from the code point of view but more overwhelming!

- create empty RStudio project (with git if it's available)

- `hugodown::hugo_install('0.66.0')`

- `hugodown::create_site_academic()`

- `hugodown::hugo_start(render_to_disk = TRUE)`, open localhost in the browser.

- Change site title and [theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/themes/) in config/_default/params.toml. Yes a theme for a theme!

- Mention academic docs, all the things one can change.

- `hugodown::use_post("post/new-rmd-post")`, knit, see post.

- say there will probably be other themes later. show Hugo theme gallery and how I would choose themes.
