We'll explore [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) with [hugodown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/).

Note that Hugo changes fast. Exciting (more features!) and scary (broken websites).

The hugodown package by Hadley Wickham is itself an experimental R package (trustworthy though!), but it pins a Hugo version to projects.
