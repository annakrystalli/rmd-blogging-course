# WHAT is is a scientific Rmd blog?

---

IMHO :smile_cat:

I'll list criteria so we have something to compare our adventures to.

---

# Tech part

* Easy way to update from Rmd without too much copy-pasting

* Fits into your existing workflow or uses things you want to learn and invest time in

* Code, syntax highlighting

* Modern tooling (html5? mobile friendly?)

---

# Science part

* References from a .bib file

* Easy way to cite posts?

* Equations with LaTeX syntax, but no LaTeX

* Content. Blog about science, or stuff relevant to science but not only (e.g. comparisons of way to fit and present linear models in R).

---

# Human part

* Accessible. Alt text, contrast. Don't add gate-keeping to science.

* You OWN it. Content, URL.

* Allow for interactions (social media? commenting?)
