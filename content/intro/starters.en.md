* In this course I expect some familiarity with R Markdown. Only the basics, some of you discovered R Markdown _yesterday_!

* I use `usethis` a lot :robot: :sparkles:, and recommend doing so. Follow [`usethis` setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html) in particular [_"Use usethis or devtools in interactive work"_](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#use-usethis-or-devtools-in-interactive-work-1) and the Git/GitHub stuff.

* If you use GitLab, not GitHub, you can follow [Heidi Seibold's instructions _"Setup Git RStudio GitLab"_](https://gitlab.com/HeidiSeibold/setup-git-rstudio-gitlab). There is no helper similar to `usethis::use_github()` to my knowledge.
