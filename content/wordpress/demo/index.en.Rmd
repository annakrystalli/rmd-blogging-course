- setup (on the WordPress side, in .Renviron) was discussed on the slides, see [goodpress setup vignette](https://maelle.github.io/goodpress/articles/setup.html)

- install the remotes package, `install.packages("remotes")`

- install the goodpress package, `remotes::install_github("maelle/goodpress", ref = "main")`

- create a folder, possibly a subfolder in a folder called "my-wordpress-posts" or so, "2020-07-03-cool-post".

- in that folder, create index.Rmd.

- in index.Rmd, paste [example content](/snippets/#goodpress-post). look at the YAML field, see also [goodpress usage vignette](https://maelle.github.io/goodpress/articles/goodpress.html)

- knit.
