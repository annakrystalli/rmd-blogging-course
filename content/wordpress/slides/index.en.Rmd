# WordPress

# Why use WordPress?

* Clicking to design the interface

* Internationalization

* Open Source

---

# Why NOT use WordPress

* Performance? 

* Security?

If you use WordPress, read the docs.

---

# Do you use WordPress?

---

# Workarounds for no WordPress

* Use a subdomain for your R Markdown blog, linked from your main WordPress website.

* Netlify CMS and other CMS as an user-friendly interface on static websites (like Hugo).

---

# Now, Rmd and WordPress!

* `knitr::knit2wp()` is now too dated (it uses `RCurl` and `XML`)

* I made a package using WordPress REST API v2!

So your choice is between a too old tool and my WIP package. :joy:

---

# wordpress.com vs wordpress.org

* Free wordpress.com: no plugin (so no API)

* Paid wordpress.com: $$$

* Your own local server: efforts

* Paid service hosting+domain name+ WordPress install: a few $ a month
