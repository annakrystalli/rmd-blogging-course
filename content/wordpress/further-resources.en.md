## Read the manual :wink:

* [goodpress docs](https://maelle.github.io/goodpress/)

* Read about WordPress in your usual WordPress channels.
And contribute good WordPress general resources to this repo. :wink:

It's good to know how your website infrastructure evolves and works.

## Follow development :eyes: and contribute to goodpress!

I have shown all there is to [`goodpress`](https://github.com/maelle/goodpress), if you want more you might contribute 

* with bug reports, feature requests;

* with code and docs.

I'd be glad to help you with R package development tips if you feel you're a n00b.

## Where to get help? :wave:

* [goodpress issue tracker](https://github.com/maelle/goodpress/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

* About WordPress itself, [WordPress forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forums/)

## Migrate your content to a static website?

No judgement on your using WordPress, of course! Keep going! :rocket:

But now that your posts are neatly organized in folders they'd be easier to migrate than if they were scattered.
Hugo docs in particular have [a section about migrating to Hugo from WordPress](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/).
