## Contribute to goodpress?

I have shown all there is to [`goodpress`](https://github.com/maelle/goodpress), if you want more you might contribute 

* with bug reports, feature requests;

* with code and docs.

I'd be glad to help you improve as an R package developer if you feel you're a n00b.

## Migrate your content to a static website?

No judgement on your using WordPress, of course!
But now that your posts are neatly organized in folders they'd be easier to migrate than if they were scattered.
Hugo docs in particular have [a section about migrating to Hugo from WordPress](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/).
