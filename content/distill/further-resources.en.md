## A warning about customization

> A word of warning though: Distill (the original library upon which the R package is based) is strongly opinionated about CSS and sometimes it's tricky or impossible to change things. Just to say your mileage may vary and if there is something you can't quite get right there is not likely much we can do about it -- *JJ Allaire [in a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/100#issuecomment-508075573)*.
